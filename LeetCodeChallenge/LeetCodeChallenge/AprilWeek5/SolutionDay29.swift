/**
 Subproblems:
 
 1. How to calculate a one-way path that has the largest value?
 Let's define a leg as the one-way path that does not pass the
 local root, which is the starting nodepassed to the recursion.
 
 2. How to find the local max-value path of a node?
 It consists of up to two non-overlapping legs since it may or may
 not pass the root. That said, legs that share the same root may not
 be included simultaneously.
 
 3. How to find the max-value path of the entire tree?
 It will be obtained by comparing the local max-value paths.
